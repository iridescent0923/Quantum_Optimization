** Main goal 
: [Gamma_ps = 8e-1 & tau = 5e-2] => Maximize CFI as flat and investigate parameters theta_x, phi_z

** Method
: Try all possible optimizer 

- L-BFGS-B: with jacobian provided

- SLSQP: with jacobian provided

- trust-constr: with jacobian, hess provided

** Procedure

Step1: Begin with L-BFGS-B using constraints: [-inf, inf]
=> Find breakaway point, peak to peak...

Step2: Predict the shape of phi_z
=> Check if the CFI is Full and flat for all PHI

Step3: Adjust initial_value
=> Reduce the noise before ~pi/2 point

Step4: Adjust the range of pi/2 ~ N
=> Find optimal N

Step5: Strice tolerance

Step6: Try SLSQP, trust-constr
